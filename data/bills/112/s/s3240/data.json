    "text": "Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2012 - Repeals, but continues for crop year 2012: (1) direct payments, (2) countercyclical payments, and (3) the average crop revenue election program (ACRE). Establishes the agriculture risk coverage program through crop year 2017 for covered crops to make payments to producers for each planted crop when actual farm or county-wide crop revenue is below the agriculture risk coverage guarantee (89% of historical revenue). Requires producers to choose individual or county coverage. Authorizes: (1) nonrecourse marketing assistance loans, (2) loan deficiency payments, (3) payments in lieu of loan deficiency payments for grazed acreage, (4) programs for upland cotton and extra long staple cotton, (5) assistance for peanuts, (6) recourse loans for high moisture feed grains and seed cotton, and (7) programs for sugar and sugar beets. Establishes a dairy production margin protection program under which participating dairy operations are paid: (1) basic production margin protection program payments when production margins are less than threshold levels, and (2) supplemental production margin protection program payments if purchased by a participating dairy operation. Provides for a transition period under which the dairy production margin protection program and the milk income loss program shall both be in existence and producers may participate in either program. Establishes a dairy market stabilization program to assist in balancing the supply of milk with demand when participating dairy operations are experiencing low or negative operating margins. Terminates the production margin protection and stabilization programs on December 31, 2017. Repeals: (1) the dairy products price support program, (2) the milk income loss contract program, and (3) the dairy export incentive program. Extends: (1) the dairy indemnity program, (2) the dairy forward pricing program, and (3) the dairy promotion and research program. Provides assistance for livestock losses caused by: (1) adverse weather or attacks by federally reintroduced animals, including wolves; and (2) drought or fire. Provides assistance for orchardists and nursery tree growers for commercial losses caused by natural disasters. Suspends permanent price supports for covered commodities, cotton, sugar, and milk through 2017. Revises payment limitation provisions. Extends the conservation reserve program and the farmable wetland program through FY2017. Revises the conservation stewardship program. Extends the environmental quality incentives program through FY2017. Establishes the agricultural conservation easement program for the conservation of eligible land and natural resources through easements or other interests in land. (Combines the purposes and coordinates the functions of the wetlands reserve program, the grassland reserve program, and the farmland protection program.) Extends through FY2017: (1) the conservation of private grazing land program, (2) the grass roots source water protection program, (3) the voluntary public access and habitat incentive program, and (4) the small watershed rehabilitation program. Establishes a terminal lakes assistance program (in lieu of the desert lakes program) for the purchase of eligible land impacted by flooded or terminal lakes and their associated watershed or riparian resources.
