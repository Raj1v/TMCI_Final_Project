Title
-----

Main trends in the changes of US congress legislation between the two US parties, Democrats and Republicans.

Abstract
--------

For the project, we will do an analysis of the congress' bills to see the parties' main governmental interests. Utilizing the text of every bill from the first dataset, we will assign each bill to a topic. We will use this information to compare whether they reflect to the ideologies of the parties in the current congress. Our interests lay whether, for instance, a republican congress actually focuses on bills with republican topics and what those topics are. Also, by comparing these results with the second dataset, which focuses on 'Lexical shifts, substantive changes, and continuity in State of the Union discourse', research whether bill topics and topics of 'the State of the Union' per time relate to each other.

Research questions
------------------

What main trends can we distinguish between the two US parties, democrats and republicans, based upon changes in legislation (bills and amendments) in the US congress?Â 

-   Which bill topics are focussed on during what times?

-   How are the votes distributed on the bill?

-   Do they get more polarized?

-   What topics are important to the president (regarding the State of the Union)?

-   What are the ideologies of both parties?

Dataset
-------

Dataset 1:  Public domain code that collects data about the bills, amendments, roll call votes, and other core data about the U.S. Congress.

-   The repository contains very clear on how to manage and process the data. We will enrich the data by assigning each bill to a topic and the kind of congress.

Examples:\
Size and format: The size of the data set is huge since it contains bills from 1790 - 2014 and also other information. The format is a GitHub repository.\

Dataset 2:  Lexical shifts, substantive changes, and continuity in State of the Union discourse, 1790--2014

-   We don't know how we will manage, process and enrich the data yet.

A tentative list of milestones for the project
----------------------------------------------

Week 11:\
Go through the data sets and find out the best way we can extract the data from them.

Week 12:\
Clean up data sets so we can use them.

Week 13:\
Have every bill assigned a topic and find out the ideology of the congress during that time.

Week 14:\
Report on the relation between topics of the bills and the congress.

Week 15:\
Compare the report to the second dataset, where the white house (president) presents for him the most important topics.

Week 16:\
Finalize project

Documentation

This can be added as the project unfolds. You should describe, in particular, what your repo contains and how to reproduce your results.
